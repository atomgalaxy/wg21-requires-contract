# Introduction

The attribute-based syntax for contracts is limiting and steps on the shared
space between C and C++. This paper explores an alternative syntax that should
offer an easier extension path.

**This paper proposes almost the same semantics as [@P2388R2].**

The only significant change from [@P2388R2] is the semantics of effect elision -
this paper specifies it as all-or-nothing, per _correctness-annotation_.

**The main non-syntactic difference between the two papers is the manner of
spelling future extensions**.

Due to the way this paper models annotations, it may leave fewer things
undefined compared to [@P2388R2], despite the fact that that it does not
propose explicit closures yet.

**Note:** this paper is an exploration. The authors do not strongly object to the
attributes-based syntax from the P2388 series; but the syntax does seem to
present certain challenges that this paper tries to address.

**Note:** WG14 has communicated that their vendors don't have a blocking
problem with the attribute-like syntax, though they have reservations; in
addition, WG21 members have expressed difficulties with teaching the *`:` means
it's not an attribute* intricacies.

## On Extensions and Viability

The authors believe that **any MVP must clearly show plausible syntax for all
known extensions**. This does not mean *propose*. It means *show*. Specifying
precise semantics for the entire extension space is not in the spirit of a
*minimum viable product*, but *viability* implies that all desired features can
at some point be supported. This means there must be syntax, so syntax we show.

# Changelog

## R0 to R1

- general clarifications and better choice of words, fixed loads of typos.
- The grammar specification separated into 
  *precondition*s, *postcondition*s, and *assertion*s, to enable more precision
  in specification.
  - the return-value parameter to a *postcondition* was made optional.
- The default capture case for member functions was changed to `[&, this]`.
  This fixes an oversight.
- We clarify that the closure was always supposed to be as-if `mutable` in the
  by-value capturing extensions.
- Greatly expanded examples, and clarified which ones are extensions and which
  ones are proposed here.
- Removed "lambda" from the paper and consistently use "closure", as the 
  mechanism for capturing values at function entry relies on lambda closures
  and their syntax, but we don't rely on the lambda body syntax.
- Split the "future extensions" sketch chapter into subclauses highlighting
  individual separable extensions.
- Highlight the different models of side-effect elision (see "An alternative
  model"), and what we give up by using a looser one than proposed here.
- Changed the destructuring of the return value example into an actually
  interesting one.
- Changed the location of the _attribute-specifier-seq~opt~_ in the extension
  allowing attributes appertaining to contract annotations.
- Added a section on testing and fuzzing contract specifications themselves.
- Clarified the relationship to abbreviated lambdas
- Added the "capture design space" section.
- Added section on considered and rejected ideas
- Clarified that contract checks are ODR-used even in _nocheck_ mode.


# Proposal

## Example

We introduce three context-sensitive keywords: `pre`, `post`, and `assert`.
`pre` and `post` are only keywords in the top level context of a function
declarator.

`pre` and `post` can appear in function declarations after the optional
trailing `requires` clause.

**Example:**

```cpp
auto plus(auto const x, auto const y) -> decltype(x + y)
    pre { x > 0 }
    pre { p1(x) && p2(x) } // compound check
    // r is as-if auto&&
    post (r) { r == (x + y) }
{
    assert { x > 0 }; // this is currently "valid" syntax,
                      // but we should reclaim it.
    auto cx = x;
    return cx += y;
}
```

One may note that this is strikingly similar to the syntax proposed in
[@N1962], way back in 2006. Our thanks to Andrzej Krzemiński for digging this up.


## Proposed syntax

Let's take a look at the generic syntax of a _correctness-annotation_ (to use
the term from [@P2388R2]):


| _correctness-specifier_:
|    _precondition_
|    _postcondition_
|    _assertion_

| _precondition_:
|    `pre` _lambda-introducer~opt~_ _correctness-specifier-body_

| _postcondition_:
|    `post` _lambda-introducer~opt~_ _return-value-decl~opt~_ _correctness-specifier-body_

| _assertion_:
|    `assert` _lambda-introducer~opt~_ _correctness-specifier-body_

| _return-value-decl_:
|    `(` _identifier_ `)`

| _correctness-specifier-body_:
|   `{` _conditional-expression_ `}`

**For the MVP, the** _lambda-introducer_ **is required to be omitted**.

If the _lambda-introducer_ is omitted, the _correctness-specifier-body_ behaves
as-if the _lambda-introducer_ was `[&]` for free functions and `[&, this]` for
member functions.

In a _postcondition_, the _return-value-decl_, if present, introduces the name
for the prvalue or the glvalue result object of the function. This identifier
is valid within the _correctness-specifier-body_. This is to support annotating
`void`-returning functions, as well as *postcondition*s that don't operate on the
return value.

All closures behave as-if their associated lambda body was declared
`mutable`. This makes no difference to `[&]`, but it does make a difference for
by-value capture extensions.

### MVP Restrictions

Naming a non-`const` value parameter in a *postcondition* is ill-formed for now.
This can be lifted by allowing copy-capture later, when we allow the
_lambda-introducer_ to appear. This is to both prevent **referencing moved-from
objects**, and to **allow the calling code to reason** about the properties of
the result object, such as in the example:

```cpp
int min(int x, int y)
    post (r) { r <= x && r <= y }; // error, x and y are not const

int min(int const x, int const y)
    post (r) { r <= x && r <= y }; // ok

int min(int x, int y)
    post [x, y] (r) { r <= x && r <= y }; // OK (extension, explicit copy)
```

The closure definition works with this - the function arguments are
captured by reference, which happens to be reference-to-`const`, given that
they are `const`, which gives the exact semantics of [@P2388R2].


# Semantics

We specify the future in a somewhat more general manner than strictly required
for the MVP, to indicate the inner workings of the future extensions.

## Evaluation order

This section describes the order of evaluation _if contract checking is
enabled_. If it's disabled, there is no evaluation, but the contract check
bodies are still ODR-used.

### Assertions

Any _assertion_ is executed as if it was an immediately-invoked lambda
expression.

### *pre* and *postcondition*s

We need to make preceding *precondition*s protect both the _lambda-introducer_
and the _correctness-specifier-body_ of any subsequent _correctness-specifier_.

Therefore, *precondition*s are first execute the
_correctness-specifier-introducer_ (if any), and then immediately their
_correctness-specifier-body_.

*postcondition*s are evaluated in two parts; their
_correctness-specifier-introducer_ is evaluated in-sequence along with
*precondition*s; and their _bodies_ are, evaluated after the function exits.

If a _precondition_ _B_ follows a _precondition_ _A_ in a function's declaration,
then no part of _B_ shall be executed before _A_ has been proven;

If a _postcondition_ _P_ follows a _precondition_ _A_ in a function's
declaration, then not even _P_'s _correctness-specifier-introducer_ shall be
executed before _A_ is proven. This is to protect initialization from
out-of-contract behavior.

No postcondition closure is executed before all *precondition*s are proven.

This means that the following execution orders are all OK:

- _A_, _B_, _P_
- _A_, _A_, _B_, _B_, _P_
- _A_, _B_, _A_, _B_, _P_
- (prove _A_ at compile time), _B_, _P_
- (inherit proof of _A_ from caller precondition), _B_, _P_

**Note:** ***proven*** above refers to either evaluated to `true`, or otherwise
pseudo-evaluated by a static analyzer or code folding so that it is known that,
should it be evaluated, it would evaluate to `true`.

## _postcondition_ reference-capture limitations in the MVP

Capturing function parameters by mutable-reference in *postcondition*s may cause difficulties for static analysis, as some expressions containing these will require interprocedural/inter-TU analysis, which may be beyond the capabilities of a compiler. Dedicated static analysis tools should still be able to handle these, however. [@P2388R2] forbids mutating function arguments.

Example (courtesy of Tomasz Kamiński):

```cpp
int pickRandom(int beg, int end)
    post [&] (r) {
        ret >= beg &&
        ret <= end
    };
```

Given that we don't know the function body, and we could have changed `beg` and
`end`, this conveys no information for static analysis (you'd have to mark
`beg` and `end` `const`).

We therefore have a choice of how to start out with this proposal:

- forbid capturing parameters by mutable reference
- forbid capturing parameters by reference altogether
- do nothing and just expect degraded static analysis performance

The stated goal of feature-bijection with [@P2388R2] for this paper says we
should forbid reference-capture for parameters in *postcondition*s.

## Side-effect elision

This MVP defines that for the purposes of optimization, the compiler is
allowed to either execute, or not, entire correctness specifiers, together with
their closures. Subexpression elimination is only permitted under the
(stricter) as-if rule.

This is because, while it should not be lippincott-discernible to the program
whether a specifier was actually executed, this might only actually be true if
the specifier gets to clean up after itself. In other words, the sum of the
parts is assumed "pure", the parts are not.

**Note:** an operation is ***lippincott-indiscernible*** if and only if program
correctness (as defined by the business purpose of the program) is not affected
by the operation. Logging is one example of a class of operations which are
usually considered lippincott-indiscernible, but again, the final arbiter is the
business purpose of the program.

### An alternative model (from P2388)

P2388 has a looser model, which the authors of this paper do not oppose. In
that model, the compiler is allowed to elide any and all side-effects
indiscriminately, from any subexpression.

That model effectively disallows lock/unlock pairs inside the body of a check,
but is unclear about lock/unlock pairs inside closure initialization, which
P2388 does not speak of.

# Future Extensions (not a proposal)

As noted in the introduction, the reason to prefer this paper to an
attribute-based syntax is the way evolution is handled.

This section shows the various ways future extensions could look like under
this proposal. These are not hypothetical, and will be proposed immediately
after this MVP is accepted.

## Explicit Captures

The main task of this proposal is enabling explicit parameter captures in the
future. The main consumer of that are *postcondition*s.

```cpp
auto plus(auto x, auto y) -> decltype(x + y)
    post [x, y] (r) {
        // capture x, y by value, *explicitly*, at point of call
        r == (x + y)
    }
{
    return x += y;
}
```

Modeling using lambda-captures allows us to explain why *postcondition*s can't
usefully refer to rvalue-reference arguments (since they might be moved-from),
and all the other possible implementation-limitations as well.

### Capturing view contents by value

Explicit captures allow capturing views by value for later checking. No "magic"
_oldof_ implementation can do this - but closures do this easily.

```cpp
template <typename T, size_t n>
void sort_contiguous(std::span<T, n> elems)
  post [on_entry = std::vector(elems), elems] { is_permutation(on_entry, elems) }
  post [elems] { std::is_sorted(elems.begin(), elems.end()) }
{
  std::sort(elems.begin(), elems.end());
}
```

It should be noted that an attribute-based syntax could allow this as follows
(from P2388):

```cpp
template <typename T, size_t n>
void sort_contiguous(std::span<T, n> elems)
  [[post ??, on_entry = std::vector(elems), elems=elems: is_permutation(on_entry, elems)]] 
  [[post ??, elems=elems: std::is_sorted(elems.begin(), elems.end())]]
{
  std::sort(elems.begin(), elems.end());
}
```

the `??` is there because the return value specifier makes little sense for a
`void`-returning function.

### Checking whether a call didn't exceed its time budget

A yet-unserved use-case is checking whether a realtime function actually runs in
the time promised; this syntax makes it easy:

```cpp
int runs_in_under_10us()
    post [start=gettime()] { gettime() - start <= 10us };
```

The authors thank Lisa Lippincott for this wonderful idea during a conversation
in Aspen a few years ago.

**Note:** Writing a contract like this in a hosted environment might not be
ideal, but in a realtime embedded chip, it might make perfect sense in the
absence of preemption.


### Checking a call didn't leak memory

With a tracking allocator, we can check we didn't leak any memory:

```cpp
int does_not_leak(allocator auto alloc)
    post [usage=alloc.usage(), &alloc] { usage == alloc.usage() }
{
  // do stuff that should not leak
  return 0;
}
```

### Grabbing only the interesting part of an input

We can optimize contracts by "remembering" just the required properties of an input:

```cpp
void append(auto& container, auto&& item)
  post [s=container.size()] { container.size() == s+1 }
{
  container.push_back(std::forward<decltype(item)>(item));
}
```

### Mutation semantics checking

Sometimes we want to check that two operations are equivalent for the given
inputs, because the algorithm is taking advantage of that.

```cpp
auto cat(auto x, auto y)
  // check += has the same semantics as (copy, +)
  pre [cx=x] { (cx+=y) == x+y }
{
  return std::move(x += y);
}
```

The above example might seem contrived, but checking the semantics of an
operation on a template type seems perfectly reasonble to the authors.

## Destructuring the return value 

There have been rumours of a proposal for destructuring in function arguments.
When the language gets that, we can just inherit that directly. A teaser that
we *could* just adopt directly:

```cpp
auto returns_triple()
    post ([a, b, c]) { c > 0 }
{
    struct __private { int __a; int __b; int __c; };
    return __private{1, 2, 3};
}
```

## Attributes appertaining to contract annotations

The syntax allows for attributes on annotations. We could use those for
vendor-defined control of execution.

```cpp
int f(int * n)
     pre                 {n != nullptr}
     pre [[acme::audit]] {*n >= 0};
```

An alternative (although the authors are not completely sure this does not
conflict with the _attribute-specifier-seq_ that appertains to the function
type):

```cpp
int f(int * n)
     [[acme::audit]] pre {*n >= 0};
```

```

void sort(auto first, auto last)
  [[post r: r > 0: audit("really expensive")]];
```

  [[post audit("really expensive") r: r > 0: ]];
```

---

```cpp
void sort(auto first, auto last)
   post [[audit( "really expensive" )]]
      [s=vector(first, last)] {
        is_permutation({first, last}, s) }
```

## Multithreaded usage / locking

Issue courtesy of Aaron Ballman:

_A potential issue with P2388R2 that is carried over into D2461R0 is
with side effect operations. Given that they're unspecified, does this
mean there's no safe way to write a portable contract which accesses
an object shared between threads? e.g., multithreaded program where a
function is passed a mutex and a pointer to a shared object; can the
contract lock the mutex, access the pointee, then unlock the mutex?_

With closure-based semantics, we can avoid this:

```cpp
void frobnicate_concurrently(auto&& x)
    // closures-are-a-future-extension.disclaimer
    pre [g=std::lock_guard(x)] { is_uniquely_owned(x); };
```

In this MVP, we allow the compiler to *assume there are no side-effects* to an
expression for the purposes of optimisation, *but they can either all be
omitted, or none may*, for a given statement, including the closure.

We therefore have a plausible RAII-based metaphor that people already understand.


## Testing and fuzzing *precondition*s and *postcondition*s

It's important to be able to test the actual precondition and postcondition
specification independent of the function they are guarding.

This is due to

 - enabling contracts should ideally not introduce _additional_ bugs.
 - contracts necessarily _narrow_ from the _wide_ contract specification;
   therefore the contract specification of the *check* is wider than the
   contract of the *function*.
 - Contracts need to "expect the unexpected". This makes them excellent candidates for fuzzing.

We could introduce a pair of reflection traits for functions:

```cpp
// unchecked precondition: y != 0
int f(int x, int y)
  pre { x / y >= 0 }
  pre [x] { x %= 3 != 0 }
  post (r) { r == x / y }
;

// assume unit-test framework with CHECK macro, like catch2
// all preconditions
CHECK(false == std::preconditions<f>(/*x*/3, /*y*/2)); // x%=3 == 0
// by-index
CHECK(true  == std::preconditions<f>[0](3, 2)); // 3 / 2 >= 0
CHECK(false == std::preconditions<f>[1](3, 2)); // 3 / 2 == 1

// all postconditions
CHECK(true  == std::postconditions<f>(/*x*/3, /*y*/2)(/*r*/1));
CHECK(true  == std::postconditions<f>[0](3, 2)(1));
CHECK(false == std::postconditions<f>[0](4, 2)(1); // 1 != 4 / 2

// fuzzer could evaluate
std::postconditions<f>[0](3, 0)(1); // UB, ubsan files bugreport
```

*postcondition*s *have* to be fuzzable independently of their functions. If the
algorithm is wrong (the very condition the postcondition is there to detect),
the postcondition should absolutely not segfault, but instead report `false`.

Traits such as above absolutely must be independently executable.

We could also introduce names:

```cpp
int g(int x)
  pre("nonnegativity") { x >= 0 }
  post("nonnegativity") (r) { r >= 0 }
;

std::preconditions<g>["nonnegativity"](1); // true
std::postconditions<g>["nonnegativity"](1); // true
```

**We could propose the same for attribute-based syntax**, but the closure +
argument model has clear semantics, and with the other alternative we'd have to
additionally specify how it works. Support for names takes some syntactic
space, which is already scarce in the attribute-based syntax.

## Summary

- We get improvements in lambda-capture grammar "for free". Once
  lambda-introducers get destructuring support, so do contracts.
- We don't have to re-specify anything regarding pack expansions, etc; lambda-introducers get us that, too.
- We can check time/environment-based contracts (see example below).
- It's consistent with the rest of the language, instead of inventing a yet-another minilanguage.


# Comparison tables with attribute-based syntax

This section explores future extensions as envisaged by [@P2388R2] and previous
papers. The comparison is also is explored in [@P2487R0].

## Referencing function arguments in *postcondition*s

There are issues with arguments that change value during function evaluation and *postcondition*s. They are described in [@P2388R2]/6.4 and 8.1.
[@P2388R2] side-steps this issue by attempting to prevent referencing modified arguments, requiring that referenced arguments should be `const`-qualified (in definitions).

The ideas using the [@P2388R2] syntax look like this (all from [@P2388R2]/8.1):

:::cmptable

```cpp
// Extension of this proposal
int f(int& i, array<int, 8>& arr)
  post [i] (r) { r >= i }
  post [old_7=arr[7]] (r)
       { r >= old_7 }
```

```cpp
// p2388r2 1)
int f(int& i, array<int, 8>& arr)
  [[post r, old_i = i: r >= old_i]]
  [[post r, old_7 = arr[7]: r >= old_7]];
```

---

```cpp
// p2388r2 3)
int f(int& i, array<int, 8>& arr)
  [[post r: r >= oldof(i)]]
  [[post r: r >= oldof(arr[7])]];
```

```cpp
// p2388r2 2)
int f(int& i, array<int, 8>& arr)
  [[post r: r >= oldof(i)]]
  [[post r: r >= oldof(arr[7])]];

```

:::

This syntax kind-of works, but is not proposed, and there is nowhere to specify
the binding type in either of the possibilities, so we must choose reference.

The non-attribute based syntax has one advantage here, which is a clear place
for the return value. If we put an additional closure initialization somewhere
before the colon, we end up in visual ambiguity of what `[]` means.

## Summary

- The closure-based syntax makes it obvious when values are captured, and even
  hints at an implementation - just put the closures on the stack before the
  function arguments.
- It doesn't invent another language for capturing values, which means the
  syntax will grow together with lambda captures.
- It makes it **obvious how to do stateful *postcondition*s** that check
  before/after: the closure runs with `pre`, the body runs after return. This
  is far from obvious with the [@P2388R2] syntax.

# Mutation and Static Analyzers

Static analyzers should be able to handle limited mutation in order to analyze
C++, and many contracts that describe function behaviour will require some
mutation of a copy. Allowing copies to be made is therefore immensely useful in
a contract facility.

We have assurances from at least some analyzer vendors they see no issue with
allowing copies and mutation in contract annotations in the future.

## Capture design space

There is design space in what kind of captures we allow of parameters of different kinds.

The case space spans between condition (`pre`, `post`) by parameter kind
(value, lvalue, rvalue) by qualifier (non-const, `const`) by kind-of-capture
(reference, value), which gives us $2*3*2*2 = 24$ cases.

The example is

```cpp
auto f(@_param_@ x)
    pre @_cap_@ { x }
    post @_cap_@ { x }
;
```

| #  | param        | cap   | cond   | MVP | Ext  |
| -- | ------------ | ----- | ------ | --- | ---- |
|  1 | `T`          | `[&]` | `pre`  | y   | y    | 
|  2 | `T`          | `[&]` | `post` | (!) | (!)  |
|  3 | `T`          | `[=]` | `pre`  |     | y    |

- **MVP**: this paper.
- **Ext**: this paper plus minimal "allow captures" extension.
- **(!)**: Capturing value arguments by reference in *postcondition*s gives no
  information to the caller, therefore it's not a well-behaved contract and we
  should diagnose (2).
- All the `[=]`-captures are missing for the MVP due to the lack of explicit
  captures, which means there is no way to spell that.

The reader is encouraged to specify their own "acceptability mask" if they want
to limit this further, and propose it in discussion. However, the authors don't
really see how any further restriction from Ext couldn't be circumvented by the
user, and (2) is protection from Murphy, not Machiavelli.

## Slight difference between P2388 and this proposal

In P2388, the declarations and definitions don't have to match in the
`const`ness of the value parameters to generate the same contract, but this
paper requires it.

### Extension of this proposal

```cpp
int min(int x, int y)
  post (r) { r <= x && r <= y }; // not ok
int min(int x, int y)
  post (r) { r <= x && r <= y } {} // not ok
```

### [@P2388R2]

```cpp
int min(int x, int y)
  [[ post r: r <= x && r <= y ]]; // ok
int min(int x, int y)
  [[ post r: r <= x && r <= y ]] {} // not ok
```

# C-compatibility

C and C++ implementations often share a set of system headers, and there will naturally be a desire to add contracts to entities in those headers.

One of the motivating reasons behind the attribute-like syntax in [@P2388R2] is that a C compiler can be reasonably updated to ignore the contracts unless/until C gets Contracts as well. It's worth noting that the proposed syntax in [@P2388R2] is still ill-formed for attributes, and a properly conforming C compiler that has not been updated to handle (ignore) the contracts would still issue diagnostics.

There is some debate as to whether it'd be a _good_ thing if a C compiler were to still accept code that has Contracts in it when the C compiler is unaware of Contracts, and it has been noted that some implementations may simply consume all tokens in an unrecognized attribute until reaching the closing `]]`, regardless of whether the internal structure of the attribute is properly conforming. Upon survey, no implementations behave this way.

The syntax proposed in _this_ paper, however, cannot be ignored by a C compiler that is unaware of Contracts - it is unarguably ill-formed C code.

This syntax lends itself easily to conditional compilation, especially with a feature-test macro:

```cpp
int my_func(int x)
#if __cpp_contracts /* Perhaps just __contracts to allow C to easily opt-in? */
  pre { x > 0; }
#endif /* __cpp_contracts */
{
  /* ... */
}
```

This is not a motivating difference from [@P2388R2] - conditional compilation can just as easily be used to guard Contracts there; the main difference in C-compatibility between these two proposals is that [@P2388R2] has a greater potential of a Contracts-unaware C compiler ignoring any contracts without a meaningful diagnostic or programmer opt-in.

# Considered and rejected ideas

This section is a log of things the authors considered and rejected, and for
which reason, so that we need not revisit prior discussions.

## Abbreviated lambdas

The _postcondition_ syntax naturally looks like a shorthand lambda:

```cpp
post [ @_closure_@ ] ( @_identifier_@ ) { @_conditional-expression_@ }
```

This topic was explored in [@P0573R2] by Barry Revzin, who proposed this syntax
as point 2.3. (alternative syntax). Notably, this was not the main proposed
syntax, which was

```cpp
post [ @_closure_@ ] ( @_identifier_@ ) => @_conditional-expression_@
```

In function declarations, this syntax ends up looking like

```cpp
int f(auto x) pre => x > 0 pre => 42 % x == 0 post [x](r) => x * r == 42 {
  return 42 / x ;
}
```

It's _parsable_, but it doesn't scan well to the human eye. Contrast with the proposed

```cpp
int f(auto x) pre { x > 0 } pre { 42 % x == 0 } post [x](r) { x * r == 42 } {
  return 42 / x ;
}
```

It has the same number of characters, but the visual terminator that `}`
provides makes everything a lot more readable.

**Reasons to reject**:

- We do not want to wait for EWG to express a stance on abbreviated lambdas
- We want the closure to be optional, which is a departure
- The proposal does not consider making the closure `mutable` by default, which
  we want. The author said this was not considered at all and may be revisited in
  a future revision, but that does not exist at present.

# Not-yet-rejected ideas

## Abbreviated lambdas with forced parentheses

The section on abbreviated lambdas notwithstanding, putting parentheses around
the expression after the `=>` restores readability, and in addition screams
_this is an expression_.

```cpp
int f(auto x) pre => (x > 0) pre => (42 % x == 0) post [x](r) => (x * r == 42) {
  return 42 / x ;
}
```

This might be a plausible future direction if the group likes parentheses better
than braces; it also allows a future extension by allowing an init-statment
echoing an if-condition with an initializer. Conversely, allowing only one
semicolon inside a braced-expression will raise questions about why there may
only be one.

## Semicolon separators in the body (a-la requires blocks)

The authors also considered separating conditions with semicolons, similarly to `requires` blocks.

```cpp
int f(auto x)
  requires {
    {x % 2} -> integral;
    {as_signed(x)} -> convertible_to<int>;
  }
  pre {
    x % 2 == 0; // short-circuits
    as_signed(x) == x;
  }
;
```

While it makes sense with `requires` blocks, the behavior of `;` in *pre*- and
*postcondition*s is identical to the `&&`-operator, because we want
short-circuiting. In addition, the lack of a `return` keyword in the body makes
the individual conditions seem disembodied.

Requiring chaining using `&&` solves this comprehension issue -- it behaves the
way it looks, and the lack of a semicolon in the body hints at the fact that
the thing between `{}` is an expression and not a statement.

In other words, we say what we mean, and we disallow the syntax that doesn't
mean what it looks like.

# Proposed Wording

TODO. Writing it will be an exercise, and the authors want to see if there is any enthusiasm for this at all before spending the time.

# Acknowledgements

- _The entire WG21_. This is a huge effort, and since contracts were pulled from C++20, the group has been showing an extraordinary level of determination to get to consensus.
- _Andrzej Krzemieński_, who has been a steadfast integrator of opinion in
  P2338 - the MVP paper sequence. I've helped a bit, but he's been
  extraordinary, and also dug up more prior art and contributed examples. _I
  thrice presented him co-authorship, which he did thrice refuse._
- _Tom Honermann_, who saw the interplay with function try-blocks.
- _Phil Nash_, for quite a few insightful comments, and the function-parameter syntax for return values
- _Peter Brett_, for encouraging me to drop the complex sequence of ;-separated conditions and stick to a single condition (subconditions separated by `&&`).
- The _BSI_ for reviewing this paper early.
- _Lisa Lippincott_, for her study of stateful function contracts and all the hours she's spent explaining the point and their shape to Gašper.
- _Tomasz Kamiński_, for *also* pointing out the function parameter syntax for
  return values, and reminding the authors that reference-captures for
  non-`const` parameters render *postcondition*s less useful for static analysis in the absence of the function body.
- _Ville Voutilainen_, for always connecting all of the weird bits of impact everything has on everything else.
- _Bengt Gustaffson_, for an amazingly long and thorough review of the R0.
